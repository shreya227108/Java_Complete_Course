#Operators & Binary Number System in Java

-Operators in Java
Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
1. Arithmetic Operators
    + (Addition)
    - (Subtraction)
    * (Multiplication)
    / (Division → gives quotient)
    % (Modulo → gives remainder)

2. Relational Operators (Return true/false)
    == (Equal to)
    != (Not equal to)
    > (Greater than)
    < (Less than)
    >= (Greater or equal)
    <= (Less or equal)

3. Logical Operators
    && (Logical AND → true if both true)
    || (Logical OR → true if at least one true)
    ! (Logical NOT → reverses result)

4.Assignment Operators
    = (Assign)
    += (Add and assign → a+=5 means a=a+5)
    -= (Subtract and assign)
    *= (Multiply and assign)
    /= (Divide and assign)
    %= (Modulo and assign)

5. Unary Operators
    ++a (PreIncrement → increases value by 1 and then use)
    ++a (PostIncrement → use and then increases value by 1)
    --a (PreDecrement → decreases value by 1 and then use)
    a-- (PostDecrement → use and then decreases value by 1)

6. Bitwise Operators
These work on binary representations of numbers.
    & (Bitwise AND)
    | (Bitwise OR)
    ^ (Bitwise XOR → true if bits are different)
    ~ (Bitwise NOT → flips bits)
    << (Left shift → multiply by 2)
    >> (Right shift → divide by 2)
    >>> (Unsigned right shift → fills with 0s)

-Binary Number System in Java

-Binary numbers use base 2 (only 0 and 1).
-Java internally stores numbers in binary format (but displays them in decimal by default).
-Since Java 7, you can write binary numbers using prefix 0b or 0B.

-Converting Decimal ↔ Binary
 Java provides methods in the Integer class:
 Ex:
     int num = 25;
     // Decimal to Binary
     System.out.println(Integer.toBinaryString(num)); // 11001
     // Decimal to Octal
     System.out.println(Integer.toOctalString(num)); // 31
     // Decimal to Hexadecimal
     System.out.println(Integer.toHexString(num)); // 19
