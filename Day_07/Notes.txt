Methods/Functions in java

1.Functions-
-A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

-Why are functions used?
    -If some functionality is performed at multiple places in software, then  rather than writing the same code, again and again,
    we create a function  and call it everywhere. This helps reduce code redundancy.
    -Functions make maintenance of code easy as we have to change at one  place if we make future changes to the functionality.
    -Functions make the code more readable and easy to understand.

-Syntax
        return-type function_name (parameter 1, parameter2,  …… parameter n){
            //function_body
        }
        return-type

-The return type of function is the data type of the variable that function returns.

-When a function does not return any value, in that case the return type of the  function is ‘void’.

-function_name
    -It is the unique name of that function.
    -It is always recommended to declare a function before it is used.

-Parameters
    -A function can take some parameters as inputs. These parameters are specified  along with their data types.

-main function
    -The main function is a special function as the computer starts running the code  from the beginning of the main function.
    Main function serves as the entry  point for the program.

2.Methods(DRY =Don't Repeat Yourself)
-sometimes our program grows in size and we want to separate the logic of main method to other methods.
-A method is a function written inside a class.
-Since Java is an Object oriented language, we need to write the method inside same class.
-Syntax of a Method
        dataType name(){
            //Method body
        }
-Calling a Method
    -A method can be called by creating an object of the class in which the method exist followed by the method call.
    -Ex:
        Calc obj = new calc(); -> Object Creation
        obj.mySum(a,b); +Method call upon an object
    -The values from the method call (a and b) are copied to the a and b of the function mySum, Thus even if we modify the values a and b
     inside the method, the values in the main method will not Change.
