1.Print the spiral order matrix as output for a given matrix of numbers.
APPROACH :
    Algorithm: (We are given a 2D matrix of n X m ).
    1. We will need 4 variables:
    a. row_start - initialized with 0.
    b. row_end - initialized with n-1.
    c. column_start - initialized with 0.
    d. column_end - initialized with m-1.
    2. First of all, we will traverse in the row row_start from column_start
    to column_end and we will increase the row_start with 1 as we have
    traversed the starting row.
    3. Then we will traverse in the column column_end from row_start to
    row_end and decrease the column_end by 1.
    4. Then we will traverse in the row row_end from column_end to
    column_start and decrease the row_end by 1.
    5. Then we will traverse in the column column_start from row_end to
    row_start and increase the column_start by 1.
    6. We will do the above steps from 2 to 5 until row_start <= row_end
    and column_start <= column_end.
2.For a given matrix of N x M, print its transpose.
