1.Print all even numbers till n.


2.Make a menu driven program. The user can enter 2 numbers, either 1 or 0.
If the user enters 1 then keep taking input from the user for a student’s marks(out of 100).
If they enter 0 then stop.
If he/ she scores :
Marks >=90 -> print “This is Good”
89 >= Marks >= 60 -> print “This is also Good”
59 >= Marks >= 0 -> print “This is Good as well”
Because marks don’t matter but our effort does.
(Hint : use do-while loop but think & understand why)


3.Print if a number is prime or not (Input n from the user).
